  <h1>Technologies, Frameworks and challenges that I will face while developing the app/project.</h1>
<h2><b>HTML:</b></h2>
  <p>HTML was a tool I used in a prior course. The fact that HTML is still useful today was one of my strongest points when I first started learning it.</p>
  <h2><b>CSS:</b></h2>
  <p>In my prior course, I used CSS. I'm pretty proficient with it, and it's great for customising applications.</p>
  <h2><b>JQuery:</b></h2>
  <p>I'm learning about JQuery for the first time from this course, YouTube, and my teacher.</p>
  <h2><b>JQuery Mobile:</b></h2>
  <p>JQuery Mobile is something I'm new to, and I'm learning about it from this course, YouTube, and my teacher.</p>
  <h2><b>JavaScript:</b></h2>
  <p>I'm learning about JavaScript for the first time from this course, YouTube, and my teacher.</p>
  <h2><b>API:</b></h2>
  <p>In this course, on YouTube, and from my tutor, I'm learning about API as a new user.</p>
  <h2><b>Visual Studio Code:</b></h2>
  <p>This Vs code is one of the best tools to work on, therefore I feel extremely at ease using it.</p>
  <h2><b>Ionic:</b></h2>
  <p>Ionic is something I'm new to, and I'm learning about it from this course, YouTube, and my teacher..</p>
  <h2><b>Angular:</b></h2>
  <p>Since I'm a new user of Angular, this course, YouTube, and my teacher are where I'm learning about it.</p>
  <h2><b>Firebase:</b></h2>
  <p>I'm a new Firebase user who is learning about it through this course, YouTube, and my teacher.</p>
  <h2><b>Notification:</b></h2>
  <p>delivering accurate information-containing buzz notifications to users' phones as soon as they arrive at their location. The trigger in particular, which is related to the preceding point, is a crucial component of this functionality for the app.</p>
  <h2><b>Keeping data persistent:</b></h2>
  <p>Both the user's shopping list and the shop coordinates used for Geofencing must be able to be stored in the app. It is possible to handle this issue technically in a number of ways, such by using session variables, cookies, or a straightforward SQLite database. I think putting one of these into practise will let the app save its data.</p>
  <h2><b>Google Maps:</b></h2>
  <p>The programme must launch Google Maps so that the user can search for a store, which, upon selection, will be added to a list of stores that need to be notified. In order to utilise the Google maps API, a key will need to be generated. These may be acquired fairly easily by logging into your Google account, going to the Google Maps Developer website, and generating the key.</p>
  <h2><b>Geofencing/Geolocation:</b></h2>
  <p>The app must monitor the user's GPS location at all times and utilise that data to decide when to send buzz alerts. Additionally, authorization to access the phone's GPS will be required. This can be done simply giving the app the geolocation of the phone using the GPS.</p> 
  <h2><b>Complexity</b></h2>
  <p>The inclusion of too many technological elements in this app could result in a hurried and incomplete completion of the project. If integrating some of the technology elements mentioned above proves to be too difficult or time-consuming, strategic sacrifices may need to be made.</p>
